However, we do not have any places around here such as supermarkets and howkers which are traditional food court in Singapore where we could enjoy a variety of meals at reasonable cost. I would like to use this opportunity to practice my learnings in Coursera. My question for this learning practice is : How can I find a convenient and enjoyable place where I could enjoy food from howkers and easily go to supermarkets in Singapore? I assume I could utilize available real estate apps and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course.\nThe following are key points which I believe relevant to the question.\n\nWhether howkers are or is located within walking distance such as within 1.0 mile(1.6km)\nWhether supermarkets or is located within walking distance such as within 1.0 mile (1.6km)\n\nBusiness Problem:\nThe challenge is to find a suitable are for rent in Singapore that complies with the demands on location. The data required to resolve this challenge is described in the following section 2, below."
